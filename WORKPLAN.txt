This workplan is to develop and maintain this package for running the Potentiodynamic Scattering Microscopy (PDSM) setup.
Check each item after testing it on the setup.


# Currently open issues

## Work in progress
* [ ] Creating place holder for new actions, signals, functions, menus
    * Choose parameters and method for background correction
    * Start speckle contrast monitor for focusing
        + added shortcut and action Ctrl+X: Show speckle contrast
    * View speckle average, drift, and contrast during the experiment
        + needs adding extra parameters to messageWidget.py
    * Display intensity variation on a single spot (with proper sampling) vs time
        + enough to adjust the routines in View.Monitor.specialTaskTrack and View.Monitor.trajectoryWidget

* [ ] Executable code
    * write down showSpeckleContrast method in monitorMain
    * complete contrastViewer.py class based on crossCut.py
    * adjust trajectoryWidget.py to show signal vs time
    * adjust specialTaskTrack to extract the signal from images

* [ ] Correcting bugs %% report urgent bugs in this list %%
    *

## To be tested
* [ ] Does this package run on the setup computer?
    * test all the buttons
    * test all the shortcuts
    * make a list of whatever does not work as expected or is simply uncomfortable
        + adjust default settings of the GUI docks in monitorMain.setupDocks()


# Overview of major tasks for running the first complete experiment

## preparation based on existing code
    0. [ ] test run with dummy camera
    1. [ ] test run with Orca on the setup
        a. [ ] selection of ROI
        b. [ ] adjustment of mean/range min/max for grayscale viewer
        c. [ ] selecting background correction option
	3. [ ] Check the help menu with especially a cheatsheet for shortcuts

## new functions for PDSM

	1. [*] monitoring speckle variance and stability
	2. [ ] monitoring the focus stability with QPD/digilent
	3. [ ] setting up binning, averaging, and other image corrections
	4. [ ] defining/applying data recording standard
	5. [ ] selecting particle of interest with cursor
	6. [ ] monitoring/recording a single particle contrast

## electrochemical measurements (related to edaq instrument)

	1. [ ] record the applied potential with digilent card, triggered by the camera

## nice features

	1. [ ] possibility of replaying a measurement on a separate screen
    2. [ ] Display the reflected beam on the little dart camera (basler), use inspiration from cameraViewer.py

## Old Bugs and Errors __[report new bugs directly on the repository using issues]__
    1. after each resize, or maybe zoom out, the width of the image is reduced by 1 pixel. not clear why!
        -> has to do something with the monitorMain.setROI() or monitorMainWidge.setup_roi_lines()


## Resolved bugs


## Requested features and Recommendations
    1. [*] make a special text pop-up method for viewing longer text such as for help, use example of messagewidget
    2. [ ] read out actual frame rate from the Hamamatsu camera
    2. [ ] add some synthetic data generation functions to the dummy camera for testing the package performance in speed and accuracy
