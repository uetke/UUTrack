Purpose: 
here are a few tips on the procedure to follow for adding new features using an example.

* preparation
One should first decide on how often the required feature is used and how computation intensitve is it. For interactive features that are called occasionally through the GUI (example: turn on/off background correction), one can follow the following procedure
- Create an Action: 
-- Create button/keyboard-shortcut in setupToolbars() and setupMenubar()
-- Create the necessary actions and signals in setupActions() and setupSignals()
-- Create/initialize necessary program variables in the init() moddule: e.g. self.bgimage


For computation-intensive routines such a high-speed saving, tracking, or feedback, one should use a specialTaskWorker which runs at a high speed in a separate thread not to freeze the GUI.
