* preparation

	1. [x] live video for alignment and exposure settings
	2. [x] selection of ROI
	3. [x] adjustment of mean/range min/max for grayscale viewer
	4. [ ] selecting background correction option
	5. [x] synthesizing Brownian particles for testing functions
	6. [x] Add help menu with especially a cheatsheet for shortcuts

* tracking

	1. [x] waterfall update
	2. [ ] event counter (?)
	3. [ ] timer to show experiment progress
	4. [x] selecting particle of interest with cursor
	5. [x] recording a single particle track
	6. [ ] saving track (preferably on the screen) with flexible extra parameters (size,x,y,stdx,stdy, etc vs time)
	7. [x] live update of the track on screen
	8. [x] adjusting tracking parameters
	9. [ ] calculating track properties such as D or other live computations
	10.[ ] recording multiple tracks simultaneously
    11.[ ] follow two line cuts at the same time


* electrokinetic actuation

	1. [x] setting up function generator
	2. [x] programming waveforms such as ramps, etc
	3. [ ] generating specific waveform based on tracking coordinates for feedback control

* review

	1. [ ]  possibility of reviewing a track on a separate screen


* Bugs and Errors
    1. in the simulate mode, one should check if the particle size is smaller than the frame size (e.g. in height) and perform suitable adjustments.
    2. after each resize, or maybe zoom out, the width of the image is reduced by 1 pixel. not clear why!

* Resolved bugs
    * crossCut.py, the data that is passed gets longer, blank image does not show up, when closing the window, the cross-cut still is updated


* Requested features and Recommendations
    * [ ] read out actual frame rate from the Hamamatsu camera
